hibernate (1.90-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of hibernate introduces significant changes to the
  configuration file structure. Previously, /etc/hibernate/hibernate.conf was
  the one-stop configuration file, supporting one suspend method (suspend2 by
  default). If you wanted to support ACPI as well, you needed a separate file
  (/etc/hibernate/ram.conf in our case).

  Hibernate now supports two new directives: Include and TryMethod. The first
  one is designed for common settings to all suspend methods (such as hooks),
  which can now be exported to a single, commonly used file (common.conf).
  TryMethod, on the other hand, is an include directive especially made for
  the different suspend methods (suspend2, disk/sysfs, ram/ACPI). If
  encountered, hibernate will load the file, try to suspend, and simply move
  on to the next TryMethod (or Include, or directive), if it failed. This
  allows different suspend methods to be tried in turn and should make your
  life much easier.

  Note that your old configuration files will continue to work, but you may
  want to consider moving over to the new structure at your next convenience.
