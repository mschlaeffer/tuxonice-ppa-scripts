hibernate (1.97-1.1) unstable; urgency=low

   * Non-maintainer upload
   * Adding dependencies from cryptdisk to the LSB init.d dependency
     headers in hibernate's init.d script. This prevents that the hibernate
     init.d script is placed at the very first of the boot sequence when
     using dependency based boot sequencing and the cryptdisk package is
     not installed. Thanks to Petter Reinholdtsen for bugreport and patch
     (closes: #458722).

    - The galeon and sylpheed-claws scriptlets by Norbert Buchmuller are now
      officially distributed (see #427376).
    - patch by Joey Hess which fixes the backlight script to work better if
      the backlight was initially below 10% (closes: #434825).

      thanks to Uwe Herman (closes: #436287).
    - prevents double execution of included configuration files Thanks to
      "CSights" and Martin Ziegler for analysing this.
      (closes: #433965, #392712).
    - patch by Matthias Hensler which fixes filewriter support for Tux-On-Ice
      (closes: #441801).
    - use start-stop-daemon instead of backgrounding ifup (closes: #422539).

    - Fix gfx_brightness if thinks the brightness is 0 (closes: #410750).
    - Add videodump to dump and reload the video RAM (closes: #410751).
    - Screen now does not lock when --no-suspend is given.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 12 Oct 2006 10:43:08 +0200

hibernate (1.94-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - properly escape amarok process listing (closes: #378282).
    - does not fail if KDE sessions are already locked (closes: #384471).
    - enables verbose output earlier (closes: #370713).
  * Merged several patches into upstream code:
    - Patch by Joey Hess to save/restore brightness levels with GFX cards
      (closes: #384140).
    - Patch against vbetool scriptlet to log stderr output to log file, and
      only let output through to real stderr if verbosity >=2 is selected
      (closes: #381927).
    - Corrected typo in hibernate.conf manpage (closes: #386799).
    - Reworded the init.d script message about invalidating stale signatures
      (closes: #381903).
    - Added ath_pci to blacklisted modules (see #383169).
    - Added scriptlet to remount /boot read-only if /boot is a separate
      partition, contains an XFS filesystem, hibernate was asked to update the
      Grub menu file, and this feature has not been disabled in the
      configuration file (closes: #317479, #317479, #386623).
      Also added README.xfs to document caveats for users of the XFS
      filesystem.
    - Improved ususpend method. Now supports USuspendRamForce (boolean) to
      pass the -f option to s2ram. Also tests with s2ram's -n option if s2ram
      is used and the option is not set. I also made disk.conf and ram.conf
      prefer the uswsusp methods, if they are available. If you do not want to
      use them, use the sysfs-{ram,disk}.conf files, which are the former
      ram.conf and disk.conf files.
    - Use /proc/net/dev instead of ifconfig to enumerate network devices,
      because the latter would ignore madwifi interfaces.
  * Now actually installs the ususpend configuration (though not
    ususpend.conf), which I had previously forgotten. Thanks to RenÃ© van
    Bevern and Christian Schuerer for pointing it out (closes: #378347).
  * Added recommendation on vbetool, thanks to Minh Ha Duong.
  * Added recommendation on uswsusp, so that the new uswsusp code gets used
    if supported by the kernel (>= 2.6.17rc1), and suspend2 is not available.
  * Fixed up recommendations (other packages that most people will want to
    use) and suggestions (other packages used but not needed by many).
  * Added a hibernation HOWTO by Barak A. Pearlmutter to
    /usr/share/doc/hibernate (closes: #377389).
  * Moved vbetool options from sysfs-ram.conf to ram.conf; they're also
    applicable to ususpend.
  * Create log file with 0644:root:adm permissions (closes: #381033).
  * Added hibernate-ram and hibernate-disk symlinks which automatically use
    ram.conf or disk.conf as configuration file, rather than hibernate.conf
    (closes: #386426).

hibernate (1.91-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Taking over principal maintainership.
  * Let's not reverse the patch for #369632. Sorry.
  * Changed BackupGrubMenuFile in example configuration to Debian location.
  * Reworded package description and copyright file a bit.
  * Added debian/watch file.
  * Just noticed that hibernate.conf(5) documents the order with which options
    are processed if specified multiple times (closes: #354341, #354350).

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Jun 2006 16:49:39 +0200

hibernate (1.91-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "I bet Joey Hess actually gets 40 hours to each day" release.
  * Acknowledge NMU by Luk Claes; thanks! (closes: #360588, #363928)
  * New upstream release. This release started out as a Debian revision, but
    upstream simply decided to fold all changes into a new release. Thanks!
    Here's a summary of what's new, see upstream Changelog for credits:
    - fixes OnSuspend/OnResume (closes: #369632).
    - improves PID detection of the running X process (closes: #350670).
    - allows to disable xmessage dialogs (closes: #350676).
    - allows pausing of audio output during suspend (closes: #350667).
    - fixes font quoting issues (closes: #350767).
    - fixes X locking with mawk (thanks to EspeonEefi) (closes: #345295).
    - now has an option to run i915resolution on resume (closes: #349491).
      Thus, we also suggest the 915resolution.
    - favour pccardctl over the deprecatedd cardctl command (closes: #361673).
    - inspired by the work of Jan Weiner, hibernate can now try different
      suspend methods until one succeeds (closes: #336635).
    - now logs timestamps (closes: #354397).
    - new configuration file structure, which allows for inclusions
      (closes: #354332).
  * Make rmdir in prerm script write stderr to /dev/null since we actually
    really don't care about *any* warnings, including those about read-only
    /usr/local.
  * Removing the suggestion for kernel-patch-suspend2. There's really no point
    in suggesting it because what hibernate actually needs is a patched
    kernel, not the patch itself. Maybe one day our kernels can "provide"
    patches... I added a note to the new suspend2.conf file instead.
  * Added a dependency on console-tools because hibernate currently needs chvt
    (closes: #345122).
  * Pushed Standards-Version to 3.7.2; no changes needed.
  * Added dpatch to the source tree to make patch tracking easier.

hibernate (1.09-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (closes: #316614).
  * README no longer refers incorrectly to hibernate-cleanup.sh (which is
    instead installed as /etc/init.d/hibernate on Debian systems).
  * Uses /bin/echo rather than the shell's built-in echo for extra
    robustness against kernel bugs (closes: #309635).
  * The grub scriptlet now edits /boot/grub/menu.lst by default, in line
    with what Debian's grub uses (closes: #313425).
  * The grub scriptlet keeps backups in /var/backup by default
    (closes: #310759).
  * Remove superfluous quotes around `uname` in grub scriptlet
    (closes: #310758).

hibernate (1.07-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Check for /var/run/suspend2-new-kernel to prevent people losing data
    by accidentally suspending with an old kernel and resuming with a

  * Provides an "Include" directive for reading other files within
    hibernate.conf (closes: #299901).

  * Updated module blacklist, including correct module names and buggy

  * Package description more accurately describes the supported suspend
    methods (closes: #297130).

hibernate (0.99-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Now the lock scriptlet works with mawk.
  * Minor tweaks from Erich Schubert <erich@debian.org>.
  * Don't Suggests: kernel-patch-swsusp, as that package is not in the
    official archive, not maintained, and not likely to be updated in the
    forseeable future.
  * Add console-tools and vlock to Recommends.
  * Don't Depend on dash (although it's still nice to have, the script
    runs faster in dash than bash).
